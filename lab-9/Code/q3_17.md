### Comparing Least-Squares with Equiripple Filter 

- They have the same transition band. 
- In magnitude response, we observe that the Least-Square filter has higher magnitude in stopband initially but then has some decay whereas the height of stopband remains same in Equiripple Filter. In both filters, the stopband ripples get wider as frequency increases. 
- In phase response, both have same linear phase before 0.5, but the Equiripple Filter grows slightly faster than the Least-squares after 0.5. They have linear phase since they have odd-symmetric h[n]. 
- In pole-zero plot, both filters have the same number of poles (50 at z = 0) and zeros(50). But 2 of the zeros are in a different position. 
- In impulse response, both filters are almost identical with very less difference (this is because they have almost the same pole-zero plot and magnitude responses)
